# Super Cloner

## Getting Started

Navigate to your account settings by clicking on your profile image and clicking on settings.

Click on developer settings and then public access tokens.

Create a github public access token [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/settings/tokens).

**Keep this in a safe place!**

When creating the public access token, make sure to enable repo access:

Once the token is created, do not navigate away from the list of tokens or you won't be able to see the token again.

Now you can run `npx super-cloner start` or `npm install -g super-cloner` and follow the prompts.

`Super Cloner` will create a `repos` folder in the current directory you are working in and clone all repos into the `repos` folder.
